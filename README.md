### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

SmartView is a powerful, flexible, mobile-friendly solution to allow the display of external content on a WordPress-powered website. Designed for [AdPointe](http://adpointe.com), SmartView is intended to allow the AdPointe family of news sites to display attributed content without the user leaving the parent site. Unlike traditional lightbox methods, SmartView is completely mobile-friendly (i.e.; not just responsive)!
